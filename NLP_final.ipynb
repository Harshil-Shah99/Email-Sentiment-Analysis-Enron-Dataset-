      " pallen Here is our forecast  pallen Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time. pallentest successful.  way to go!!! pallenRandy, Can you send me a schedule of the salary and level of everyone in the scheduling group.

The land is selling for $2.50 per squarefoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in WestSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  Thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects, just as the duplexes do now.If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as thereis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is notyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I willknow more on this question later today.Sincerely,George W.

It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows: 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.  2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and        October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.Sincerely,Phillip Allen pallenLiane, As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.

If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?

Can you make sure the gas desk is included.Phillip pallenGeorge, Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate project: Ownership Structure What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner? What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity(regarding ownership and  liabilities)? Who owns the land? improvements? Who holds the various loans? Is the land collateral? Investment  What happens to initial investment? Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?  Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement? When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment schedule? Investment Return Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment? Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed? Debt Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each  loan? Improvement Construction Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement. Terms of each loan? Uses of Funds How will disbursements be made?  By whom? What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing for investors? Reports to track expenses vs plan? Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a  general contractor and paid gain out of profits? Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits? Design and Construction  When will design be complete? What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units? What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting? Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals?  Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking? Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use? Names?These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn asmuch as possible from the process.Phillip       pallen---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/19/2000 04:35 PM ---------------------------\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AMPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>To: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>cc: \"Larry Lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xlsEnclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austinthat we told you about.

This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.

Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.

The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.

A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..

RichardsCreekside Builders, LLC - Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls pallenGeorge, Here sales numbers from Reagan:   As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals actually done to date.    Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was rejected on the De Ville property.Phillip Allen     pallenJeff, What is up with Burnet?Phillip pallenJeff, I need to see the site plan for Burnet.  Remember I must get written approval from Brenda Key Stone before I can sell this property and she has concerns about the way the property will be subdivided.

I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845.  I will go ahead and mail you another check.  If the first one shows up you can treat the 2nd as payment for October. I know your concerns about the site plan.  I will not proceed without getting the details and getting your approval.

I will drive by Friday evening. I will let you know next week if I need to see the inside.  Can you find out when Chelsea Villa last changed hands and for what price?

I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which  I might become involved with Creekside.  Are you in the business of brokering properties or contacts?  Is your position based on a legal or what you perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a project from scratch? I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.

This would produce an average sqfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought hissales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sellfor $203,108.What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) therent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your ownevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if wewere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroomunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.Sincerely,George W.

I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for  around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated that he had more units under construction that would be  available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.   As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.

The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for power quality reasons.The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months due to distribution infrastructure issues.

The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and computer servers for the                  region's growing number of dot-coms.                        Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up construction                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than a mile from its                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones, the                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, Microsoft and Onvia.com.                        Exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near Seattle.                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, Globix and                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house the networking                  equipment of the Internet economy.                        It is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite Web sites.                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and server farms, are                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent Valley that some                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and Puget Sound                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, high-security                  facilities.                        \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\" said Karl                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound Energy. \"That is                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.\"                        A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the Internet                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads.                        Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington Utilities and                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. The                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing residential and business                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each,                  Karzmar said.                        Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to bring up the data center                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                        For the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the                  region, this is a new and complex issue.                        On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power --                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The facilities run 24 hours a                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that they could                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures.                        Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates                  in the area is still open to debate.                        \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense loads,\" said Bob Royer,                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle City Light.                        \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium lights at the football                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. We have data                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts.\"                        With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate complex in Tukwila is                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased the 1.35 million                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from Boeing Space &                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 92 percent of the                  six-building complex to seven different co-location companies.                        \"It is probably the largest data center park in the country,\" boasts Laurent                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG Communications,                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama Networks all                  lease space in the office park.                        After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, Sabey has become an                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole claims his firm is                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in the country.                        As more people access the Internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for co-location space in                  Seattle continues to escalate.                        But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center space is growing at a                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and California.                        Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location space, plans to nearly                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. While companies                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many high-tech companies                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as Exodus that                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic management.                        \"We have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more demand right now                  than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account executive at Exodus in                  Seattle.                        The booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility                  industry perplexed.                        \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth,\"                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. \"The utility industry is almost stunned by this, in                  a way.\"  pallenIna, Can you pull Tori K.'s and Martin Cuilla's resumes and past performance reviews from H.R.---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/06/2000 10:44 AM ---------------------------John J Lavorato@ENRON09/06/2000 05:39 AMTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Re:  The commercial support people that you and Hunter want to make commercial managers.   pallenresumes of whom? pallen---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000 01:50 PM ---------------------------\"Christi Smith\" <christi.smith@lrinet.com> on 09/05/2000 11:40:59 AMPlease respond to <christi.smith@lrinet.com>To: <Phillip.K.Allen@enron.com>cc: \"Debbie Nowak (E-mail)\" <dnowak@enron.com> Subject: RE: Receipt of Team Selection Form - Executive Impact & Influence ProgramWe have not received your completed Team Selection information.

The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs actual of .79   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs actual of .99   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the monthly postings   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.    Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any questions.Phillip   pallen Alan, You should have received updated numbers from Keith Holst.  Call me if you did not receive them.Phillip pallenSuzanne, Can you give me more details or email  the plan prior to meeting?  What do I need to provide besides headcount? Otherwise any afternoon next week would be finePhillip pallenColleen, Please add Mike Grigsby to the distribution. On another note, do you have any idea how Patti is holding up?Phillip pallenBrad, With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to others in that category at year end.   Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.  Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori. Let me know if there are any issues.Phillip pallenBruce,Can you stop by and set up my reuters.Phillip pallenLucy, The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add these modifications: 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below. 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  =e6-g6. 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the        letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider. 4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.Phillip pallenLucy, I got your email with the attachment.  Let's work together today to get this donePhillip pallenyou have my approval pallenLucy, We can discuss your email later.  How is progress on creating the spreadsheets.  You will probably need to close the file before you attach to an email.  It is 2:00.  I really want to make some progress on these two files.Phillip pallenLucy,Please open this excel file and input the rents and names due for this week.  Then email the file back. pallenOpen the \"utility\" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1).You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months.  If we have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper.  Use the rates described in the spreadsheet.  This is a great chance for you to practice excel. pallen ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/30/2001 11:21 AM ---------------------------Alan Comnes04/27/2001 01:38 PMTo:\tPhillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:\tJoe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject:\tRequest from Steve KeanPhillip,I got this request.

Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next week's \"Ken Lay Tour\" to CA.  He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get these three documents by Monday afternoon?   pallenMac, Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year    Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising.    Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share. Current price 37 Nat. Gas 34 Crude  10 Total  81  Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, Tosco, and SLB?Thank you, Phillip pallen---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 08/20/2000 05:39 PM ---------------------------\"Lucy Gonzalez\" <stagecoachmama@hotmail.com> on 08/15/2000 02:32:57 PMTo: pallen@enron.comcc:  Subject: Daily Duties      Phillip,           We have been working on different apartments today and having tolisten to different, people about what Mary is saying should i be worried?ants seem to be invading my apartment.You got my other fax's Wade is workingon the bulletin board that I need up so that I can let tenants know aboutwhat is going on.Gave #25 a notice about having to many people staying inthat apt and that problem has been resolved.Also I have a tenant in #29 thatis complaining about #28 using fowl language.I sent #28 a lease violation wewill see how that goes                                                  call you tomorrow                                           Thanx Lucy________________________________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com pallen---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 08/20/2000 05:38 PM ---------------------------\"Lucy Gonzalez\" <stagecoachmama@hotmail.com> on 08/16/2000 02:44:36 PMTo: pallen@enron.comcc:  Subject: Daily Report       Phillip,               The a/c I bought today for #17 cost $166.71 pd by ck#1429      8/16/00 at WAL-MART.Also on 8/15/00 Ralph's Appliance Centerck#1428      frig & stove for apt #20-B IVOICE # 000119 AMT=308.56 (STOVE=150.00     (frig=125.00)DEL CHRG=15.00\\TAX=18.56 TOTAL=308.56.FAX MACHINE FORFFICE CK # 1427=108.25 FROM sTEELMAN OFFICE PRODUCTS.

Now that we have had several traders managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu (Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to discuss them.Please let me know if you are unable to attend. pallenColleen, I am out ot the office on Friday, but Keith Holst will attend.  He has been managing the Transport on the west desk.Phillip pallenLucy, Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping. First, I want to implement the following changes:  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic operations. Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all the checks since Jan. 1. When you open the file, go to the \"Checkbook\" tab and look at the yellow highlighted items.

Could you give me a basis for the period :Sept -00 - May 31, 2006Sept-00 - May 31, 2008Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread be on these terms.Thanks, Mike pallenWade, I understood your number one priority was to deal with your vehicle situation.  You need to take care of it this week.  Lucy can't hold the tenants to a standard (vehicles must be in running order with valid stickers) if the staff doesn't live up to it.

He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.

Please read the following memo sent to you a few days ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com on the command line of your browser.The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.

I think I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.  The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.Phillip pallenLucy, I want to speak to Wade myself.  He can call me at work or home. Or if you email me his number I will call him.   I would like Gary to direct Wade on renovation tasks and you can give him work orders for normal maintenance. I will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office.  Do you need Mary to come in on any more Fridays?  I think I  can guess your answer. I might stop by this Friday.Phillip pallenhttp://ectpdx-sunone.ect.enron.com/~theizen/wsccnav/ pallen---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 06/12/2000 10:55 AM ---------------------------   \t\t\tFrom:  Tim Belden                           06/11/2000 07:26 PM\tTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Thoughts on PresentationIt is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  The WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but there can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" generation.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn't schedule their generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is better than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal consumer then it is obviously a different story.Let's talk. pallenCheck out NP Gen & Load.

The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and I'll take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of $235,019.   (If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988) Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to GDP-Kingsgate. Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:Price caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

They were polite regarding asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a weather product.As to your other question.

In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main contacts at SW Gas?We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Laird pallenKay & Neal,Thanks for remembering my birthday.  You beat my parents by one day.  The family is doing fine.  Grace is really smiling.

Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very difficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).  According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. Key Points of the Bridge FinancingInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 BLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B   Bear Stearns  $625 MTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exemptProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%Current Projected Blended IR:  5.38%Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis. SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments. pallen---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 05/04/2001 10:15 AM ---------------------------James D Steffes@ENRON05/03/2001 05:44 AMTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Re: Western Wholesale Activities - Gas & Power Conf.

Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.

He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?Thank you,Phillip pallenGary,I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well?Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.Phillip Allen pallenRay,Is there any detail on the gas cost proxy.  Which delivery points from which publication will be used?  Basically, can you help us get any clarification on the language \"the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California\"?Phillip pallen Andrea,After reviewing Bryan Hull's resume, I think he would be best suited for the trading track program.  Please forward his resume to Karen Buckley.Phillip pallenNed,Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:Price caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as compared with the previous year.Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary reductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC (U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any questions or need any further information. pallenLucy,Here is the rentroll from last friday.  The closing was to be this Thursday but it has been delayed until Friday April 20th.  If you can stay on until April 20th that would be helpful.

However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get back in touch with you once he is finished.Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager from San Antonio.  For my first development project, I feel more comfortable with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local relationships.  I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final determination on unit mix and site plan.Phillip Allen pallenJacques,The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit \"B\" are as follows:Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 is outstanding.Kohutek- $2,150 Cuatro- $37,800George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this amount.The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 appraisal and $2,375 engineering).    I couldn't find any reference to this cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the  sellers to be executed.Phillip pallenJohn,Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter.  Keith said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity.  I still believe Frank should receive the same signing incentives as Keith.  Phillip pallenThanks for the response.  I think you are right that engaging an architect is the next logical step.  I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the floor plan.He got back to me yesterday with his first draft.  He took my plan and improved it.  I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.  While he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification list.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on Friday April 13th.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through that day?  Also can you provide some references?Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust your bid.  Phillip pallenDo you have a distribution list to send this to all the traders.Phillip---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/04/2001 07:11 AM ---------------------------To: Fred Lagrasta/HOU/ECT@ECT, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT, James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EEScc:  Subject: EES Gas Desk Happy HourFred/Phillip/Scott:  We are having a happy hour at Sambuca this Thursday,  please be our guests and invite anyone on your desks that would be interested in meeting some of the new gas desk team.http://www.americangreetings.com/pickup.pd?i=172082367&m=1891Thank you,Jess pallen Ina, Can you please forward the presentation to Mog.Phillip---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/18/2001 02:50 PM ---------------------------From:\tKaren Buckley/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/18/2001 10:56 AM CDTTo:\tPhillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:\t Subject:\tRE: Presentation to Trading Track A&AHi PhilipIf you do have slides preapred,, can you have your assistant e:mail a copy to Mog Heu, who will conference in from New York.Thanks, karen -----Original Message-----From: \tAllen, Phillip  Sent:\tWednesday, April 18, 2001 10:30 AMTo:\tBuckley, KarenSubject:\tRe: Presentation to Trading Track A&AThe topic will the the western natural gas market.

Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.) pallenhttps://www4.rsweb.com/61045/ pallenJacquesI am out of the office for the rest of the week.  Have you ever seen anyone miss as much work as I have in the last 6 weeks?  I assure you this is unusual for me.Hopefully we can sign some documents on Monday.  Call me on my cell phone if you need me.Phillip pallenReagan,I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans?  Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment  2%- overhead  4%- profitI just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.Phillip pallenCary,Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simplefarmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:There will be a double porch across the back just like the frontNo dormers (Metal roof)1/2 bath under stairsOverall dimensions are 55 by 40What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  Morecabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.Reagansuggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I wantto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking aboutbringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the frontporch wouldbe smaller.I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go aheadand have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose abuilder.I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentionedmy alternative is $0.60/ft.

All the desks are trying to use this program to train analysts to be traders.  Your experience should help you in the process and make the risk rotation unnecessary. Unless you are dying to do another rotation is risk.Phillip  pallenno problem pallenReagan,Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a list of questions on the specs:1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same?2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory joist?3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or Cellulose?5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know the difference between an apron and a stool.7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron railings?15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except for change orders?I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to call Cary Kipp tosee about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.PhillipI  pallenLarry,Jacques has sent a document to Claudia for your review.  Just dropping you a line to confirm that you have seen it.Phillip pallenJacques,Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only paymentthat George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the engineer.I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the partnership.  I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.Let me know what you think.Phillip pallen---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/27/2001 02:29 PM ---------------------------Hunter S Shively03/26/2001 10:01 AMTo: phillip.k.allen@enron.comcc:  Subject:  pallen---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/27/2001 12:06 PM ---------------------------Hunter S Shively03/26/2001 10:01 AMTo: phillip.k.allen@enron.comcc:  Subject:  pallenGreg,Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf (rentable)What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2% overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.Why is profit only 4%? Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost?Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.

He still wants to receive this payment.Phillip pallenReagan, Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind. Specific features include: Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs Wood stairs Two story porches on front and rear Granite counters in kitchens and baths Tile floors in upstairs baths Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers) Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths Solid wood interior doors Windows fully trimmed Crown molding in downstairs living areas 2x6 wall on west side Undecided items include: Vinyl or Aluminum windows Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 sides   I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, but  only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.   Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a box with a simple roof  line.

Regular mail, overnight, wire transfer?  I don't see how their bank will make the funds available by Friday unless I wire the money.  If that is what I need to do please send wiring instructions. pallenGreg,Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than the full replatting process of 3 weeks?Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.Phillip pallenkeith holst sent you an email with the details. pallenJacques,The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might object to the language that \"the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the Project\".   Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required. Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.Phillip pallen---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/26/2001 10:03 AM ---------------------------To: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Current Gas Desk ListHope this helps!

My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the closing statement or on some other document.Phillip pallenJacques,I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear this up.Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was clean.  What is your inclination?Call as soon as you have a chance to review.Phillip pallen---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/15/2001 03:41 PM ---------------------------Mike Grigsby03/14/2001 07:32 PMTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Matt SmithLet's talk to Matt about the forecast sheets for Socal and PG&E.

Any special reasons?It looks like there are five vacancies #2,12,20a,35,40.  If you want to run an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine.I will write you a letter of recommendation.

According to BPA,it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meetbiological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so inorder to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it hadbeen telling California's Department of Water Resources that thesales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today thanyesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California becauseof concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sendingexchange energy into California, however.More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of theWestern Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter. pallenThanks for the information.  It would be helpful if you would send the detailed worksheet that you mentioned.I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones granted this January.

I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed.  We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that.  Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used.Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about moving this project forward.Phillip pallenHere is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format.

Keith and I think this is a joke.  We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market.  My version of a buyout is attached.I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  Since their costand fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I wouldn't think they would stand a chance.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding theproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are anumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forwardon the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on aBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjustedpro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we areacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about 500+units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, this,we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a seriouseffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requestedloan amount to $8,868,000.I have summarized our issues as follows:1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $4172.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unitturn over.3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can supportdebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x debtcoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provideequity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:     Land -                   $1,121,670     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000     Cash Equity              $1,419,268     Total                    $2,955,9387. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage ofactual hard construction costs.(See attached file: MAPTTRA.xls) - MAPTTRA.xls pallenDarrell,Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like to proceed and develop the property.  My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would also like to compare construction and development services between what you can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.  Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural work to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is Quattro Consultants out of Buda.  Let me know if you have an opinion about either.I look forward to working with you.

Specifically that the costs of ourproject are too high.  I have gathered more information that support myconcerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around$10.5 million.  The components are as follows:     Unit Cost, Site work, &     builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million     Land                      1.15     Interim Financing               .85     Common Areas                     .80     Total                         $10.4Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unableto get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class Aproperties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos canproduce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments forlocation and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognizethat Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental ratesthat are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do notbelieve that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and costestimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  Hefeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement thatwe cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to discussalternatives.Phillip pallen The insurance company is: Central Insurance Agency, Inc6000 N., LamarP.O.

Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.Phillip    pallen---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/05/2001 01:59 PM ---------------------------   \t\t\tFrom:  Phillip K Allen                           03/05/2001 10:37 AM\tTo: jim123@pdq.netcc:  Subject:  pallenI have not received the aircard 300 yet.Phillip pallenDon,I was out last week.

Her move in date was 2/6.  It is not on any rentroll that I can see.#9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she will start paying on #9#15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to collect the $95 in question.#33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?#26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.  Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.#44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of the year.#33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to figure these out immediately.I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll in case you need to research these questions.I will not be in the office next week.

Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) willbe in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within theacceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.

I will set up a room with Kim.Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the        parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and TAGG but the issues facing        scheduling in Unify are grey.2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the \"assume it is messed up\" policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need further      scrutiny.3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training courses, review progress and make cuts.5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add    some value and direction to the group.In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD to work part time to get it done.Phillip pallen---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 12/13/2000 11:28 AM ---------------------------From: Sarah Novosel@ENRON on 12/13/2000 10:17 AM CSTTo: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stephanie Miller/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, pkaufma@enron.com, pallen@enron.comcc:  Subject: Enron Response to San Diego Request for Gas Price CapsPlease review the attached draft Enron comments in response to the San Diego request for natural gas price caps.

Their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of \"construction management\" fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million.Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management fee is included.George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will review and let you know what I think.The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process.Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only true costs + 1.4 million.Phillip pallenGeorge,Please send the latest cost estimates when you get a chance this morning.Phillip pallenJeanie,Lavorato called me into his office to question me about my inquiries into part time.

Your earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to.  If the answer to this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and send it back.Now I am going to work on a rentroll for this Friday.

If they can really build this many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.Mark----- Forwarded by Mark Whitt/NA/Enron on 02/09/2001 03:04 PM -----\tTyrell Harrison@ECT\tSent by: Tyrell Harrison@ECT\t02/09/2001 09:26 AM\t\t \t\t To: Barry Tycholiz/NA/Enron@ENRON, Mark Whitt/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul T Lucci/NA/Enron@Enron, Kim Ward/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stephanie Miller/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t cc: \t\t Subject: California Gas Demand GrowthIf you wish to run sensitivities to heat rate and daily dispatch,  I have attached the spreadsheet below.Tyrell303 575 6478 pallenLucy,Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject to caps.

Sorry it is so late.There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?6.  #14  missed on 2/2?7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?8.  #20a missed on 2/2?9.  #35 missed on 2/2?My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  You may have sent me a message over the \"chat\" line that I don't remember on some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the bank deposit.Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.

Could it be valued on an 11 or 12 cap? pallenJacques,Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?  The key business points are:1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted.Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some tweaking.  Phillip Allen713-853-7041pallen@enron.com pallenLucy,Here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save.  My only questions are:1.  Neil Moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on 12/01.  Even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the beginning      of the two week period.

There are too many to list individually pallenJeff,My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I would net around $20K cash.  You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.Phillip pallenJeff,I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns.  What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far.Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get started on the list.Email or call  me later today.Phillip pallenSusan,Raised your issue to Sally Beck.

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British ColumbiaHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwestregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paidabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.But that still wasn't enough juice.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawattsof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawattsof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the$250/MWh price cap.The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. Themunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess powerinto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWPis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suitclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal BonnevillePower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into themarket at prices 10 times higher.Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying alltransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the stateno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is havingto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willingto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday duringa conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergencyWednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declaredwhen the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power isinterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only asa means of attracting additional electricity resources.\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"Dorinson said.Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energyunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost ofthe high-priced power.SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to highwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow bynearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retailcustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricityrates or if companies will absorb the costs.-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South BayPwr Plant(This article was originally published Wednesday)LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California IndependentSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke EnergyCorp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the statesince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for thereasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to theISO.The ISO manages grid reliability.As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alertat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state woulddip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid gridcollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rollingblackouts.The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representativesin June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.   -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872;jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 =DJ Calif Regulators Visit AES,Dynegy Off-LinePower Plants(This article was originally published Wednesday)   By Jessica Berthold   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRESLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) saidWednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped bysome of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimatereasons.The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's powergrid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California PublicUtilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all powerplants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW forunplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergencyfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% andcustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may becalled on to do so.As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesdayevening.Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AESand Dynegy Tuesday evening.AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspectionof the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesdaymorning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman AaronThomas said.Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representativesreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions CreditsThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities haveused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken downtwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air QualityManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,Thomas said.AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entireHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitosand Redondo Beach plants.The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AEShas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine thecompany $20 million for polluting.\"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,\"Thomas said. \"It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air qualitydistrict's\" authority.As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AEScould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its offline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUCDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesdayevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off lineWednesday.\"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if youneed to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'\" said Dynegyspokesman Lynn Lednicky.Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance andthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which couldpose a safety hazard if not repaired.\"We've been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"Weeven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\"Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation ofwhy its units were off line.-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

Let's meet on Monday to assess the issuePhillip pallenGot your email.  I will let Jacques know.  I guess we can work out the finer points next week.  The bank here in Houston is dealing with their auditors this week, so unfortunately I did not hear from them this week.  The are promising to have some feedback by Monday.  I will let you know as soon as I hear from them.Phillip pallenGeorge,The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.  The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.  pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work)Phillip AllenPS.

Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs.2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite.3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.Sales Price  705,0001st Lien   473,5002nd Lien  225,000Transfer fee    7,500Cash required   14,500NOI   100,0001st Lien    47,2922nd Lien   23,694Cash flow  29,014Cash on cash  200%These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price.Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.Phillip pallen---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/31/2001==2007:12 AM ---------------------------Susan J Mara@ENRON01/30/2001 10:10 AMTo: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Angela Schwarz/HOU/EES@EES, Beverly=20Aden/HOU/EES@EES, Bill Votaw/HOU/EES@EES, Brenda Barreda/HOU/EES@EES, Carol==20Moffett/HOU/EES@EES, Cathy Corbin/HOU/EES@EES, Chris H Foster/HOU/ECT@ECT,==20Christina Liscano/HOU/EES@EES, Christopher F Calger/PDX/ECT@ECT, Craig H=20Sutter/HOU/EES@EES, Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES, Debora Whitehead/HOU/EES@EES,=20Dennis Benevides/HOU/EES@EES, Don Black/HOU/EES@EES, Dorothy=20Youngblood/HOU/ECT@ECT, Douglas Huth/HOU/EES@EES, Edward=20Sacks/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Eric Melvin/HOU/EES@EES, Erika Dupre/HOU/EES@EES,==20Evan Hughes/HOU/EES@EES, Fran Deltoro/HOU/EES@EES, Frank W=20Vickers/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gayle W Muench/HOU/EES@EES, Ginger=20Dernehl/NA/Enron@ENRON, Gordon Savage/HOU/EES@EES, Harold G=20Buchanan/HOU/EES@EES, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@ENRON, Iris Waser/HOU/EES@EE=S,=20James D Steffes/NA/Enron@ENRON, James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EES, James=20Wright/Western Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Jeff Messina/HOU/EES@EE=S,=20Jeremy Blachman/HOU/EES@EES, Jess Hewitt/HOU/EES@EES, Joe=20Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kathy=20Bass/HOU/EES@EES, Kathy Dodgen/HOU/EES@EES, Ken Gustafson/HOU/EES@EES, Kevi=n=20Hughes/HOU/EES@EES, Leasa Lopez/HOU/EES@EES, Leticia Botello/HOU/EES@EES,==20Mark S Muller/HOU/EES@EES, Marsha Suggs/HOU/EES@EES, Marty Sunde/HOU/EES@EE=S,=20Meredith M Eggleston/HOU/EES@EES, Michael Etringer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael=20Mann/HOU/EES@EES, Michelle D Cisneros/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike M Smith/HOU/EES@EES=,=20mpalmer@enron.com, Neil Bresnan/HOU/EES@EES, Neil Hong/HOU/EES@EES, Paul=20Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Paula Warren/HOU/EES@EES, Richard L=20Zdunkewicz/HOU/EES@EES, Richard Leibert/HOU/EES@EES, Richard=20Shapiro/NA/Enron@ENRON, Rita Hennessy/NA/Enron@ENRON, Robert=20Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Roger Yang/SFO/EES@EES, Rosalinda Tijerina/HOU/EES@EES,==20Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@ENRON, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott=20Gahn/HOU/EES@EES, Scott Stoness/HOU/EES@EES, Sharon Dick/HOU/EES@EES,=20skean@enron.com, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Tanya Leslie/HOU/EES@EES, Tas=ha=20Lair/HOU/EES@EES, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Terri Greenlee/NA/Enron@ENRON, Ti=m=20Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tony Spruiell/HOU/EES@EES, Vicki Sharp/HOU/EES@EES,=20Vladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Wanda Curry/HOU/EES@EES, William S=20Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jubran Whalan/HOU/EES@EES, triley@enron.com, Richard =B=20Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert C Williams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT,==20dwatkiss@bracepatt.com, rcarroll@bracepatt.com, Donna=20Fulton/Corp/Enron@ENRON, gfergus@brobeck.com, Kathryn=20Corbally/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Bruno Gaillard/EU/Enron@Enron, Linda=20Robertson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ren, Lazure/Western==20Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Michael Tribolet/Corp/Enron@Enron,=20Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard B=20Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, jklauber@llgm.com, Tamara Johnson/HOU/EES@EES, Robert =C=20Williams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: =20Subject: Highlights of Executive Summary by KPMG -- CPUC Audit Report on=20Edison----- Forwarded by Susan J Mara/NA/Enron on 01/30/2001 10:02 AM -----=09\"Daniel Douglass\" <Douglass@ArterHadden.com>=0901/30/2001 08:31 AM=09=09=20=09=09 To: <Barbara_Klemstine@apsc.com>, <berry@apx.com>, <dcazalet@apx.com=>,=20<billr@calpine.com>, <jackp@calpine.com>, <glwaas@calpx.com>,=20<Ken_Czarnecki@calpx.com>, <gavaughn@duke-energy.com>,=20<rjhickok@duke-energy.com>, <gtbl@dynegy.com>, <jmpa@dynegy.com>,=20<jdasovic@enron.com>, <susan_j_mara@enron.com>, <Tamara_Johnson@enron.com>,==20<curt.Hatton@gen.pge.com>, <foothill@lmi.net>, <camiessn@newwestenergy.com>=,=20<jcgardin@newwestenergy.com>, <jsmollon@newwestenergy.com>,=20<rsnichol@newwestenergy.com>, <Curtis_L_Kebler@reliantenergy.com>,=20<rllamkin@seiworldwide.com>=09=09 cc:=20=09=09 Subject: CPUC Audit Report on EdisonThe following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG aud=it=20report on Southern California Edison:=20I. Cash NeedsHighlights:SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=plete=20cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=s=20and other measures.=20Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=.8=20million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.II. Credit RelationshipsHighlights:SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20extend or renew credit as it has become due.At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=lt.=20Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=nd=20payable.SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond==20indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =its=20rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade==20issues within the last three weeks.III. Energy Cost ScenariosHighlightsThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under= such=20scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.IV. Cost Containment InitiativesHighlightsSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital==20improvement component as follows (in millions):Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77Capital Improvement Costs                383Total                                             $ 460The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to==20be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=om=20contract employees.Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the==20most part being deferred to a future date.SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20savings of approximately $92 million.V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20Activity)Highlights:As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s==20Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=e=20end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit==20balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20D.01-01-018.Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20expressed in the TRA, are overstated.TURN ProposalAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=RN=20to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=s.=20Our comments are summarized as follows:The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=t=20would not directly generate nor use cash.The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=ift=20costs between two regulatory assets.TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and= the=20revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =in=20the TRA is overstated.VI. Flow of Funds AnalysisHighlights:In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a==20positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to==20its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its==20shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=on=20stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=ve=20and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.[there is no Section VII]=20VIII. Earnings of California AffiliatesSCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500==20million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.==20This increase correlates to the increase in market pricesfor natural gas for the same period.A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20www.cpuc.ca.gov.=20Dan pallenLucy,What is the latest?

Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have about $225K invested in the stagecoach,  it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.  I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee and Jaques Craig can work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.Checkout this spreadsheet.These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.   However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the time and I don't trust Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from now on.  I will have the operating statements complete through December by this Friday. Phillip pallen---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/29/2001 12:14 PM ---------------------------To: <cbpres@austin.rr.com>cc:  Subject: Re: SM134  George,Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract.  Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November)      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule      -5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon.Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626Phillip   pallenGeorge,We should hear from the bank in Houston on Monday.The best numbers and times to reach me:work 713-853-7041fax 713-464-2391cell 713-410-4679home 713-463-8626pallen70@hotmail.com (home)pallen@enron.com (work)I am usually at work M-F 7am-5:30pm.

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would \"retain\" $106 million (of what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December (and maybe earlier).PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get some assurances of payment. SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due on 2/2/01.For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements (Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this occurred today.Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it. pallenPatti,This sounds like an opportunity to land a couple of analyst to fill the gaps in scheduling.  Remember their rotations last for one year.

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,\" said William Burson, a trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\" But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. \"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,\" McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices. \"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. \"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. \"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \"It's the talk of the town here,\" he said. A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. \"It's all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \"I was getting worried,\" he said. Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. \"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It's time to consider some changes.\" To reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to severly@kcstar.com. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------All content , 2001 The Kansas City Star   pallenmessage board pallenneed help.   pallenplease remove my name and information from the registered user list.

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract.  Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November)      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule      -5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon.Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626Phillip   pallenLucy,Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.

Please email or call.Phillip Allenpallen@enron.com713-853-7041 pallenQuestions about 12/29 rentroll: There were two deposits that were not labeled.  One for $150 and the other for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13? Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For what periods? What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!  That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this right?  Has the deposit been made yet? A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.Phillip pallenit is ok with me. pallencannot open this file.

In attendance were Ken Lay, the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor's comments:Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This was a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California.State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more widely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be able to help out here).Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's thoughts and get them to Kari)He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- not just the 5 one year strips.He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today. pallenTrading ProfitsP. Allen  200M. Grigsby 463Rest of Desk 282Total  945I view my bonus as partly attributable to my own trading and partly to the group's performance.

Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur.Phillip pallenJim, I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a \"forward commitment\" in order to reduce the equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks.  I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you. Let me know what else you need.  The land is scheduled to close mid January.Phillip Allen pallenJeff,Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility connections?  Other rezoning costs?  What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him grazing rights?What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we are pushing the process as fast as we can.Phillip pallenSteve,I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future       replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.                    This creates a shortage in later months. 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.                        Specific questions should include:    1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage?  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system.         I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                     LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market and the      consumer has benefitted.  Call me if you need any more input.Phillip pallenLucy, Here is a rentroll for this week.  The one you sent for 11/24 looked good.  It seems like most people are paying on time.  Did you rent an efficiency to the elderly woman on a fixed income?  Go ahead a use your judgement on the rent prices for the vacant units.  If you need to lower the rent by $10 or $20 to get things full, go ahead. I will be out of the office on Thursday.

Note that theconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than ourstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratioof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costsare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we haveactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psfwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairlysure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detachedgarages, which would rent for $50-75 per month. - winmail.dat pallen---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 11/16/2000 02:51 PM ---------------------------To: Faith Killen/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Re: West Gas 2001 Plan  Faith, Regarding the 2001 plan, the members of the west desk are as follows: Name   Title  Trading Phillip Allen  VP Mike Grigsby  Director Keith Holst  Manager(possible Director) Janie Tholt  Director Steve South  Director Frank Ermis  Manager Tori Kuykendall  Manager Matt Lenhart  Analyst(possible associate) Monique Sanchez Commercial Support Manager Jay Reitmeyer  Senior Specialist Ina Rangel  Assistant (split costs with middle market) Marketing Barry Tycholiz  Director Mark Whitt  Director Paul Lucci  Manager (possible Director) 2-3 TBDDo I need to give you the names of our operations group?Special Pays-  I believe Mike Grigsby has a retention payment due this year.

The Democratic cauc=us is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double= dip\" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=ll be very difficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=e would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General= Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=l disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the =details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they= will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get =paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20=20According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend= to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.=20Key Points of the Bridge FinancingInitial Loan Amount:=09$4.125 BLenders:=09=09JP Morgan=09=09$2.5 B=09=09=09Lehman Brothers=09=09$1.0 B=09=09=09Bear Stearns=09=09$625 MTax Exempt Portion:=09Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exemptProjected Interest Rate:=09Taxable Rate=09=095.77%=09=09=09Tax-Exempt Rate=09=094.77%Current Projected=20Blended IR:=09=095.38%Maturity Date:=09=09August 29, 2001For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion= authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=ier in the crisis.=20SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for= bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and= the DWR proportionately from rate payments. pallen---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 11/01/2000 11:33 AM ---------------------------Jeff Richter10/20/2000 02:16 PMTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Generationhttp://westpower.enron.com/ca/generation/default.asp pallenBob, Activate Plan B.

I have one other investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background information on Larry and yourself would be helpful. Background Questions:  Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in Creekside. Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project description, investors, business entity,  Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors. Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on recent projects. With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the investors.  Preferable Investment Structure: Developers guarantee note, not investors. Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing. Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.         Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.Sincerely,Phillip Allen  pallenBob, Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy Gay was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.  If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti.  She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time. Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. specialist.  Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.  Let me know what is an acceptable cash amount.Phillip pallenAndy, Please assign a user name to Randy Gay.Thank you,Phillip pallenAndy, I spoke to John L. and he ok'd one of each new electronic system for the west desk.

Crocker\" <clclegal2@aol.com> Subject: Investment StructureSTRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.
